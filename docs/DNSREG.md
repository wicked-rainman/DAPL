Shell script `dnsreg` enables regular expression pattern matching against the stored DNS historical records
generated by `dnsreg_update`. 

#### dnsreg_update

dnsreg_update should be run after dns_auth_update so that it processes the most recent historic DNS data.
It takes this input file, filters it, and writes DNS records out to individual files that each 
contain up to 100,000,000 records. 
The script relies on four bash environment variables:

-   DNS_REG - A directory to hold the split output (Input for dnsgrep).
-   TEMP_SORT - A directory for temporary files used during sorting
-   REG_TMP - A directory for temporary holding of sort results.
-   DNS_HISTORY - The existing directory used for incomming DNS updates by dns_auth_update

Typically, the DNS_REG directory should be held on solid state storage.

Once dnsreg_update has completed, the scrip dnsgrep can be used with DNS_REG to perform
pattern matching for domain names.
