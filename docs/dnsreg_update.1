.SH NAME
gdns_reg_update \- A bash script to populate a series of split files that hold hostnames and IP addresses

.SH SYNOPSIS 
gdns_reg_update [dns json history dump file]

.SH DESCRIPTION
.BI gdns_reg_update
is a Bash script that processes a json formatted sonar history file into sorted unique files that
each contain 100,000,000 IP/hostname records. The input file is held in $DNS_HISTORY/$1, and the
output files are written to the $DNSREG directory. 
.SH Notes
This is a long running process. Due to the large file sizes, sorting requires temporary work space
as defined by the $TEMP_SORT environment variable.
