add_asn - Using an existing IP address field, Add an ASN field
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.B #include externs.h
.sp
.BI "void add_asn(char " "*IP_ADDRESS_FIELDNAME" );
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
The
.BR add_asn ()
function first tests to see if the current record contains a field 
.BR _DROP 
with a positive value. If the result is positive, then 
.BR add_asn() 
returns without performing any function.
A test is then performed to see if IP_ADDRESS_FIELDNAME exists in the current record structure.
If one is present, then the associated value is extracted from the record and 
searched for in the file set by the bash variable $ASN_FILE. If the IP address is found, then 
the ASN value is inserted into the record structure as fieldname 
IP_ADDRESS_FIELDNAME.asn.
