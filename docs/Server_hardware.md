### Server hardware requirements

-   Only tested on modern versions of Fedora (last test was on version 29)
-   Memory not critical. 16Gb-32Gb should be fine.
-   Multi-core CPU. Processors with greater than 6 (12 threads) cores exhibit little gain.
-   NOT suitable as a target for VM.
-   Disk storage, recommend 3 off 3dXpoint drives (500Gb), SSD boot and spinning rust as backup.
-   Network interface to suit (last test was on bonded dual Gb)
-   VERY efficient cooling. All available cores will often run at 100% for extended periods
